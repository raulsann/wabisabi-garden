Hey friend!

I’m **Raul San Narciso Holguera** and this is my online garden. I cultivate it with **things that give me energy**.

If you’d like to collaborate in what I do feel free to [schedule some time on my calendar](https://calendly.com/raulsan).

## 🚀 What I’m building
* **[Monday.vc](http://monday.vc/)**: our goal is to help people wake up to work that matters.

## 📝 What I’m writing

## 🏄 Where I am
* Most likely, at a place where I can kitesurf. Check on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/raulsannarciso/) and say hello if we are close.

## 🔮 Some forecasts
* The adoption of digital currencies will outpace the use of fiat currencies.
* We will create a solution for climate change. The hardest part of this process will be to clean our dear oceans.
* Things kids will learn (at school or at home) from an early age:
    * emotional intelligence.
    * sexuality.
    * spirituality & meditation practices.
    * systemic constellations.
* Robots will do all work that doesn’t require emotional intelligence.
* Most people will stop eating meat.
* Most people will not need to work to survive and will spend most of their time doing what they love.
